### What I find interesting

I always found the speed at which everyone started using chatGPT fascinating. One week, chat didn't exist, and the next week it seemed like everyone had used it at least once. Only a few weeks later, I've seen chatGPT mentioned in every single one of my syllabi for all of my classes.

I think the idea to implement an additional feature to chatGPT in order to preseve its reputation as an AI tool and not a cheating mechanism is interesting. I often use it as a starting point for difficult readings and projects, but never a replacement for my own work, which has greatly improved my productivity, understanding of class material, and helped with finding inspiration. I hope that this feature protects the reputation of chatGPT as a tool for prouctivity and inspiration, allowing students to use it in classrooms- because it's best used as a glorified Google search, (and not as a replacement for critical thinking, talking to professors/tutors, or actually doing assignments) which I know has harmlessly helped students now that everyone has access to such a powerful (and free!) tool.

## Comment
I think AI plagarism checker is even harder to develop to come close to a near functional state for the educators to rely on. As stated in the article, AI plagarism detecting tool is not fully accurate. Though it is a good first step to help shape the world to adatp to the AI in a good direction. It is undeniable that the future will heavily rely on AI and ML. There will be less "useless, boring" work that's required to be done by the human.
