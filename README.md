### What I find interesting

I always found the speed at which everyone started using chatGBT fascinating. One week, chatGBT didn't exist, and the next week it seemed like everyone had used it at least once. Only a few weeks later, I've seen chatGBT mentioned in every single one of my syllabi for all of my classes.

I think the idea to implement an additional feature to chatGBT in order to preseve its reputation as an AI tool and not a cheating mechanism is interesting. I often use it as a starting point for difficult readings and projects, but never a replacement for my own work, which has greatly improved my productivity, understanding of class material, and helped with finding inspiration. I hope that this feature protects the reputation of chatGBT as a tool for prouctivity and inspiration, allowing students to use it in classrooms- because it's best used as a glorified Google search, (and not as a replacement for critical thinking, talking to professors/tutors, or actually doing assignments) which I know has harmlessly helped students now that everyone has access to such a powerful (and free!) tool.
